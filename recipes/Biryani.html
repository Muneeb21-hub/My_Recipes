    <li>2-3 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
    <li>2-3 green chilies, slit</li>

    <li>1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped</li>
    <li>Saffron strands soaked in 2 tablespoons of warm milk (for garnish)</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>Marinating the Chicken:</h3>
  <p>1. In a mixing bowl, combine the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, salt, lemon juice, and cooking oil to make the marinade.</p>
  <br>
  <p>2. Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and mix well to coat them evenly. Cover the bowl and let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, preferably longer in the refrigerator.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Preparing the Rice:</h3>
  <br>
  <p>1. Wash the Basmati rice under running water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes.</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    2. In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add the soaked rice along with green cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, and salt. Cook the rice until it's 70-80% cooked (it should still have a slight bite). Drain and set aside.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Assembling the Biryani:</h3>
  <p>
    1. Heat oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan or biryani pot. Add the sliced onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove half of the fried onions and set them aside for garnishing.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    2. Add the marinated chicken to the pan with the remaining onions. Cook the chicken over medium-high heat until it's partially cooked and the oil starts to separate from the masala. This should take about 10-12 minutes.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
   3. Layer the partially cooked rice evenly over the chicken in the pot.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    4. Sprinkle the chopped mint and coriander leaves over the rice. Place the slit green chilies on top.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    5. Drizzle the saffron milk mixture over the rice for a beautiful color and aroma.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    6. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with aluminum foil to trap the steam. Reduce the heat to low and let the biryani cook for 20-25 minutes. You can also place a heavy object on top of the lid to ensure a proper seal.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    7. After 20-25 minutes, turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for another 10 minutes before opening the lid. This allows the flavors to meld.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    9. Gently fluff the biryani with a fork, mixing the layers together.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    9. Garnish with the reserved fried onions.
